## This is a repo of all my notes from learning software development starting 02/2025.

> [!NOTE]
> Some content has been re-written and transferred from my other note files, mostly to go over old topics as a refresher. This is mostly early JS fundamentals.

## Naming Convention

* Files starting with `init` are only inital drafts and require further work.

## References

This repo includes a references file to sites that I have previously found very useful and would like to revisit at some point.
